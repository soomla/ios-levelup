<!-- updates when you have any -->
<!-- end updates -->

ios-levelup is a library built for easily modeling game structure and user progression, and allows rapid protoyping using a standard and simplified model.

**ios-levelup** is used only for writing _LevelUp_ related data to an iOS device storage, from game-engine related modules such as [unity3d-levelup](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-levelup) and [cocos2dx-levelup](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-levelup).
Please see the aforementioned modules to use the full capabilities of the _LevelUp_ module.
